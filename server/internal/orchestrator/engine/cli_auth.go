// nothing since the same credential produces the same failure every time.

// authInvalidTailWindowBytes bounds how much of the *end* of a CLI's output
// detectAuthInvalid inspects, instead of the full transcript. Agentic CLIs
// routinely emit thousands of lines of tool-call trace per run (the same
// reason cli_spec_step.go's lastN truncates to 2000 chars for logging), and
// legitimate work on auth-related code produces incidental text matching
// these patterns mid-transcript — a test asserting a 401 response, a
// comment about a revoked token, generated auth middleware. A real "not
// authenticated" failure, by contrast, is always at or near the end of the
// output: it's the reason the CLI stopped, so there's little left to print
// afterward. Bounding the match window to the tail keeps recall for genuine
// failures (REQ-002's motivating incident: an "OAuth token revoked" message
// right before the process exited) while dropping mid-transcript false
// positives from unrelated, successful work.

// AuthInvalidConfidence classifies how strongly an auth-invalid match
// implies the credential is genuinely broken, so callers can scale their
// reaction accordingly instead of treating every match the same:
//
//   - AuthInvalidConfirmed: matched a profile-specific rule, wording
//     verified against a real binary for that exact CLI. Safe to treat as
//     permanent — skip remaining retries, disable the credential.
//   - AuthInvalidSuspected: matched only the generic "*" fallback list.
//     Broader, less specific patterns (e.g. bare "401", "unauthorized")
//     that can incidentally match legitimate output (a test asserting a 401
//     response, a comment mentioning a revoked token). Treated as an
//     ordinary retriable failure instead — worth a warning so a human can
//     add a profile-specific rule if it recurs, but not worth disabling a
//     possibly-still-good credential on a guess.
